# Seasoned â€“ The seasonal veggie recipe 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

## How are we feeling? 
Slightly stressed but driven to want to see this project succeed, mostly feeling good and confident. 
Ash: Slightly quiet and stressed with the ideas of the challenge.
Brendan: Feeling good and comfortable with the full stack development.
Pei: Slightly stressed and nervous with the ideas of the challenge.
Tomas: Feeling good after a honey session.
Zin: Feeling good and ready to work on the project.

## Wellbeing?
As a group, most of us are sleeping pretty well. After a discussion around stress profiles, we mostly decided to ensure communication when we are feeling stressed, taking breaks is essential to our success. We will take two main breaks, lunch break (1h to 2h max) and honey break (30 minutes). Extra breaks may be used once applicable. One way to mitigate this stress from happening is to acknowledge it openly and walk away for 5 - 10 mins. 
Ash: I like to talk things through as a way of reassuring what is going on.
Brendan: communicate to the stress level to the team and go for a work out to destress.
Pei: Let my pair know and take a short break.
Tomas: I will communicate with my pair and have some time for myself.
Zin: Go to the balcony and have some fresh air.


## General needs and time commitments?
None of us have any overly critical work/life commitments. We will be coming into campus on saturday except for Brendan from 9am to 5pm. Sunday will be a rest day. 

Daily goals, work to tasks, and stay overtime if tasks are not yet completed. This expectation should enable us to stay on track, sticking to our timeline. 
The timeline will be on a whiteboard and have clear technology, tasks and expectations for the day. 
Our kanban will be physical and made with post its notes that will be moved around according to the actions status.

Regular stand-ups and discussions around the task-flow. At least every 2 hours. 

Standard schedule will be 9am to 5pm but flexible for team members that may want to change it slightly or carry on working late hours maximum of 2 to 3 hours.

## Conflict and communication
An odd number makes it easier to make decisions through voting. If a conflict arises, the topic will be broken down and mediated with the success of the project at the center.   

Scrum leader will be in charge of managing conflicts and in case scrum leader is involved in a conflict, vibe watcher will take it over.

## What do we want to get out of this time? 
A useful outcome to showcase at interviews and for our portfolios. Experience working in a group, and practicing human skills. Getting some fun out of the experience. 

## Paper scissors rock
When making decisions as a group, it might be a good idea to use an external factor to make the decisions. Also showing evidence/rationale of your ideas during group talks. Give an example. 
Vibe watcher will be facilitating conflict resolution and general mood.
Task-based approach will be used by following a kanban board and user stories.

## Where do we go to find help?
Google, facilitators, each other. Help will be requested after 15-20 min someone is struggling to resolve a problem.

## Inclusivity
To ensure inclusion we will be consciously mindful of each other's needs/moods. During the stand ups questions regarding peoples needs will be asked.

We may be coding in pairs depending on the product demands, particularly when we will be coding front and back end. Scrum leader will check whether everyone is on track during the stand up meetings.

Ash, Pei and Zin will be leading the front end initiatives while Brendan and Tomas will be in charge of the back end initiatives.

## Conversations
Based on the user stories and the pairs we will decide who needs to be present.  

## Roles
Git Keeper: Pei
Vibe Water: Ash, Brendan
Scrum Lead: Tomas
Product owner: Zin
Design lead: Ash

## Chill time
Socialize, eat together, music and honey time. (on toast)
Standard lunch time will happen in-between 12pm and 2pm and chill time will happen after we have achieved the task of the day. Most lunches most of the team will eat together.

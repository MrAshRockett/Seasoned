# Seasoned â€“ The seasonal veggie recipe 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

## How are we feeling? 
Slightly stressed but driven to want to see this project succeed, mostly feeling good and confident. 

## Wellbeing?
As a group, most of us are sleeping pretty well. After a discussion around stress profiles, we mostly decided to ensure communication when we are feeling stressed, taking breaks is essential to our success. One way to mitigate this stress from happening is to acknowledge it openly and walk away for 5 - 10 mins. 

## General needs and time commitments?
None of us have any overly critical work/life commitments. We will be coming into campus on saturday except for Brendan. Sunday will be a rest day. 

Daily goals, work to tasks, and stay overtime if tasks are not yet completed. This expectation should enable us to stay on track, sticking to our timeline. 
The timeline will be on a whiteboard and have clear technology, tasks and expectations for the day. 

Regular stand-ups and discussions around the task-flow. At least every 2 hours. 

## Conflict and communication
An odd number makes it easier to make decisions through voting. If a conflict arises, the topic will be broken down and mediated with the success of the project at the center. 
Task-based approach.  

## What do we want to get out of this time? 
A useful outcome to showcase at interviews and for our portfolios. Experience working in a group, and practicing human skills. Getting some fun out of the experience. 

## Paper scissors rock
When making decisions as a group, it might be a good idea to use an external factor to make the decisions. Also showing evidence/rationale of your ideas during group talks. Give an example. 

## Where do we go to find help?
Google, facilitators, each other.

## Inclusivity
To ensure inclusion we will be passively mindful of each other's needs/moods.

## Conversations
Based on the user stories and the pairs we will decide who needs to be present.
